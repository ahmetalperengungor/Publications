A list of my publications can be found here:

2:) Astrophysical Data Analysis contains our paper that we wrote under Sabancı Program for Undergraduate Research Programme PURE (as a co-first author) for analyzing black hole pairs. Cannot display papers in PURE website because of privacy concerns, therefore uploaded to my github.
